 * One Escape dispatcher for the whole app, because Escape has to mean exactly

 * playlist modal, then viewer, then trim, then the player bar.
 *
 * Registering a document listener per surface does not reproduce that. Capture
 * listeners fire in registration order, not in stacking order, so a trim modal
 * opened from the viewer would be closed second rather than first. Here the
 * most recently opened surface is the one that answers, which is the same
 * order without anyone having to maintain the list.
